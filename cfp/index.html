    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        With advances in remote sensors, sensor networks, and the proliferation of location sensing devices in daily 
        life activities and common business practices, the generation of disparate, dynamic, and geographically 
        distributed spatiotemporal data has exploded in recent years. In addition, significant progress in the ground, 
        air- and space-borne sensor technologies has led to unprecedented access to earth science data, including 
        polar data, for scientists from different disciplines, interested in studying the complementary nature of 
        different parameters. These developments are quickly leading toward a data-rich but information-poor environment. 
        The rate at which geospatial data are being generated clearly exceeds our ability to organize and analyze 
        them to extract patterns critical for understanding in a timely manner a dynamically changing world. 
        Access to such data can help address important challenges such as climate change, sea-level rise, and 
        their impact on communities through transformative spatiotemporal data science and machine learning. 
        This workshop focuses on advances at the intersection of Geospatial AI, Machine Learning, and Spatiotemporal 
        Computing in order to address these scientific and computational challenges and provide innovative and effective solutions.  
    </p>
    <p>
        More specifically, efficient, reliable, and explainable AI, Machine Learning, and Data Mining techniques are 
        needed for extracting useful geoinformation from large heterogeneous, often multi-modal spatiotemporal 
        datasets (e.g., remote sensing, GIS, trajectory, geo-social media). Traditional techniques are ineffective 
        as they do not incorporate the idiosyncrasies of the spatial domain, which include (but are not limited to) 
        spatial autocorrelation, spatial context, and spatial constraints. Extracting useful geoinformation and 
        actionable knowledge from several terabytes of streaming multi-modal data per day also demands the use 
        of modern computing in all its forms (clusters to the cloud). Thus, we invite all researchers and 
        practitioners to participate in this event and share, contribute, and discuss the emerging challenges 
        in Geo-spatial-temporal AI, Machine Learning, and Data Mining.
